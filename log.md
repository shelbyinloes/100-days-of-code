# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on getting general layout started for my Widget Workshop app. Fixed the React Router to work with my navigation buttons. Created a logo for the site. Deployed site using Netlify. But most importantly - started somthing to help me to stay on track! 

**Thoughts:**: Excited to finally get a practice plan in progress. Once I get the WW site up and running, I want to implement some older projects into it to add content. I think I have a good handle on React Router, just need to fix the nav bar as well as the bootstrap grid issues. Hope to see even more progress tomorrow.

**Where/When I Worked**: Mostly at home mid day, had the day off for NYD. Finished up a couple things at Yard Bar around 5.
