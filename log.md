# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on getting general layout started for my Widget Workshop app. Fixed the React Router to work with my navigation buttons. Created a logo for the site. Deployed site using Netlify. But most importantly - started somthing to help me to stay on track! 

**Thoughts:**: Excited to finally get a practice plan in progress. Once I get the WW site up and running, I want to implement some older projects into it to add content. I think I have a good handle on React Router, just need to fix the nav bar as well as the bootstrap grid issues. Hope to see even more progress tomorrow.

**Where/When I Worked**: Mostly at home mid day, had the day off for NYD. Finished up a couple things at Yard Bar around 5.

**Tomorrow's Goals:**: Fix bootstrap issues, finish general WW layout.

### Day 2: January 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Realized all of my bootstrap issues were because I forgot to add the CDN into my index.html file... So once that was up I started working through fixing the layout how I wanted. Towards the end of the night I started brainstorming how I would tackle translating Vanilla JS files (with Canvas, mind you) into a JSX/React Component. 

**Thoughts:**: I am in for a lot, but will also learn a lot. I want to be able to push myself. Even if that means I get stuck and don't make a ton of progress in one day - just means I have less things to attempt the next day. 

**Where/When I Worked**: Had a slow afternoon at the WESTL clinic, so got some work done there (maybe 2 good hours). Finished up some work at home from 7-8:30ish. Typing this at 9:30 then headed to bed!

**Tomorrow's Goals:**: Refresh memory on event handling, state, and prop types. Start tackling a canvas project if I can!

### Day 3: January 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Today I didn't get a ton of work done, mostly started work on the Calligraphy component. I found a great article that covers an example canvas jsx in react. Not functional yet!

**Thoughts:**:  Needed more uninterupted time today. Going to be a couple days to finish this canvas project!

**Where/When I Worked**: At work, in the break room. I have my computer out at Mardigan's right now, would not be able to do much of todays work right now. 

**Tomorrow's Goals:**: Make a functioning Calligraphy app! (or at least one you can draw on)

### Day 4: January 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Forgot my computer at Mardigan's so I didn't get as much done today. I worked on two coding challenges in JS. One where I returned how many vowels were in a string, and started work on the stairstep. 

**Thoughts:**:  I need to practice this much more! I'm pretty rusty in JS functions. 

**Where/When I Worked**: At Mardigan's on the couch (pretty distracting place).

**Tomorrow's Goals:**: More canvas! More functions! More everything. Its Saturday so I want to work several hours.

### Day 5: January 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Worked several hours on Canvas but didn't really get anywhere. It's too complex and I need to take a step back to understand event handling, props, state, etc. I found an old video of Renee's so I am going back through and rebuilding Towers of Hanoi. 

**Thoughts:**:  Really struggling with basics of JS React. Need to truly understand state and event handlers. 

**Where/When I Worked**: Mardigan's room while he was at a volleyball tournament. I worked from like 10 or 11 to 2ish. 

**Tomorrow's Goals:**: Finish Towers & study React.

### Day 6: January 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Finished Renee's video on Towers in React and added in a win alert! 

**Thoughts:**:  Getting the hang of writing in react again. State + event handling is very important and I want to make sure I really get this. 

**Where/When I Worked**: Worked at home between 8:15p and 10:00p. I enjoyed most of my Sunday computer-free (:

**Tomorrow's Goals:**: I would like to do a lot of non-coding study time, as well as clean up my Towers Project.

### Day 7: January 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Tried out several styling techniques for the mapped (ring) items, but ran into several dead ends. Did general styling on Towers and Clock componenets. I also added in a popup for game rules and a reset button for Towers.

**Thoughts:**:  Need to learn more about keeping an index with each mapped item (or just looking at content). Small progress is still progress!

**Where/When I Worked**: Worked just a little bit this morning at work. Spent time coding during the bachelor too - so not super concentrated work. 

**Tomorrow's Goals:**: New Component? Study time? We will see!

### Day 8: January 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Today was a busier day, so mostly worked through some javascript-exercises work! Learned more about some javascript array/string methods and also what an octal literal is. 

**Thoughts:**:  Did not have as much time today as I would have hoped, but I have a lot more time tomorrow. I need to get better with pop, push, shift, and unshift. 

**Where/When I Worked**: At work, in little spouts. 

**Tomorrow's Goals:**: Many many things!

### Day 9: January 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Hodge Podge day! During work I spent a little bit of time on the reverse number JS function. Had a couple hurdles to get over like how to keep the negative sign at the beginning, and how to get rid of the trailing 0's. This evening I added some more projects to my portfolio page, and did a minior styling change to towers of Hanoi. 

**Thoughts:**:  Learned more about scope, and a simpler way to check for leading/trailing 0's by using a while loop and .pop(). 

**Where/When I Worked**: A little bit at work (should have been able to do more) and a little bit at home!

**Tomorrow's Goals:**: Change up my coding time! Going to code before work and gym in the evening. I've felt very distracted once I get home, maybe this will help. Hope to get back into the backend this weekend.

### Day 11: January 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Went through a tutorial on making a to-do app! 

**Thoughts:**:  Well I forgot to post about this day and got lost, so dunno. 

**Where/When I Worked**: Starbucks Coffee from 6:15 - 7:15am. 

**Tomorrow's Goals:**:

### Day 11: January 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Learned a little bit more about my to-do app code. Added in a delete button that is attached to the ID instead of the input it was originally in.

**Thoughts:**:  Need to learn more about the code I'm actually writing & be able to discuss it. 

**Where/When I Worked**: Summer Moon Coffee from 6:15 - 7:15am. 

**Tomorrow's Goals:**: Whatever my heart desires!

### Day 12: January 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Not a lot of work got done today... I enjoyed my first ATX Sprint Squad workout, lunch at Malibu Poke, and HH w/ Roya at Lazarus. Sometimes it's important to have 'me' days! I spent some time looking at old classwork from ACA today. 

**Thoughts:**:  Need to have a dedicated goal for tomorrow, and time not at Mardigan's place. 

**Where/When I Worked**: Mardigan's table while they watched TV.

**Tomorrow's Goals:**: Have something tangible to show!

### Day 13: January 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Realized I was a day behind on my coding log, guess the weekend was good for my brain! I was pretty preoccupied with fun stuff, workouts, meal prepping, etc to spend the time on my own projects. I instead did some JS30 work on the sliding nav bar.

**Thoughts:**:  This was fun! Would be really cool to implement into a full stack project soon. 

**Where/When I Worked**: At home, from about 9pm to 10:30pm.

**Tomorrow's Goals:**: Code. Code. Code. Maybe a JS function warm up, then getting back to the backend work.

### Day 14: January 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Great Monday! I was able to smash through at least two JS funciton exercises! I also spent some time going through my Towers of Hanoi project and found the key/index error and it wasn't even where I thought it was messing up. I also figured out a way to use that key to style each individual p tag differently. 

**Thoughts:**: Great job today (to myself!), you rocked it! I also got a chance to encourage another developer who is currently in school. I love that I can connect with so many people and inspire others to keep the code going. 

**Where/When I Worked**: A tiny bit in Dr. Sundqvists office, mostly at home during and post Bachelor (about 7:00pm to 9:30pm).

**Tomorrow's Goals:**: Add Widget Workshop to my portfolio page for sure! If I have time I would like to make the styling on Towers prettier. But tomorrow is also my first job placement course, so we will see!
