# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on getting general layout started for my Widget Workshop app. Fixed the React Router to work with my navigation buttons. Created a logo for the site. Deployed site using Netlify. But most importantly - started somthing to help me to stay on track! 

**Thoughts:**: Excited to finally get a practice plan in progress. Once I get the WW site up and running, I want to implement some older projects into it to add content. I think I have a good handle on React Router, just need to fix the nav bar as well as the bootstrap grid issues. Hope to see even more progress tomorrow.

**Where/When I Worked**: Mostly at home mid day, had the day off for NYD. Finished up a couple things at Yard Bar around 5.

**Tomorrow's Goals:**: Fix bootstrap issues, finish general WW layout.

### Day 2: January 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Realized all of my bootstrap issues were because I forgot to add the CDN into my index.html file... So once that was up I started working through fixing the layout how I wanted. Towards the end of the night I started brainstorming how I would tackle translating Vanilla JS files (with Canvas, mind you) into a JSX/React Component. 

**Thoughts:**: I am in for a lot, but will also learn a lot. I want to be able to push myself. Even if that means I get stuck and don't make a ton of progress in one day - just means I have less things to attempt the next day. 

**Where/When I Worked**: Had a slow afternoon at the WESTL clinic, so got some work done there (maybe 2 good hours). Finished up some work at home from 7-8:30ish. Typing this at 9:30 then headed to bed!

**Tomorrow's Goals:**: Refresh memory on event handling, state, and prop types. Start tackling a canvas project if I can!

### Day 3: January 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Today I didn't get a ton of work done, mostly started work on the Calligraphy component. I found a great article that covers an example canvas jsx in react. Not functional yet!

**Thoughts:**:  Needed more uninterupted time today. Going to be a couple days to finish this canvas project!

**Where/When I Worked**: At work, in the break room. I have my computer out at Mardigan's right now, would not be able to do much of todays work right now. 

**Tomorrow's Goals:**: Make a functioning Calligraphy app! (or at least one you can draw on)

### Day 4: January 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Forgot my computer at Mardigan's so I didn't get as much done today. I worked on two coding challenges in JS. One where I returned how many vowels were in a string, and started work on the stairstep. 

**Thoughts:**:  I need to practice this much more! I'm pretty rusty in JS functions. 

**Where/When I Worked**: At Mardigan's on the couch (pretty distracting place).

**Tomorrow's Goals:**: More canvas! More functions! More everything. Its Saturday so I want to work several hours.

### Day 5: January 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Worked several hours on Canvas but didn't really get anywhere. It's too complex and I need to take a step back to understand event handling, props, state, etc. I found an old video of Renee's so I am going back through and rebuilding Towers of Hanoi. 

**Thoughts:**:  Really struggling with basics of JS React. Need to truly understand state and event handlers. 

**Where/When I Worked**: Mardigan's room while he was at a volleyball tournament. I worked from like 10 or 11 to 2ish. 

**Tomorrow's Goals:**: Finish Towers & study React.

### Day 6: January 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Finished Renee's video on Towers in React and added in a win alert! 

**Thoughts:**:  Getting the hang of writing in react again. State + event handling is very important and I want to make sure I really get this. 

**Where/When I Worked**: Worked at home between 8:15p and 10:00p. I enjoyed most of my Sunday computer-free (:

**Tomorrow's Goals:**: I would like to do a lot of non-coding study time, as well as clean up my Towers Project.

### Day 7: January 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Tried out several styling techniques for the mapped (ring) items, but ran into several dead ends. Did general styling on Towers and Clock componenets. I also added in a popup for game rules and a reset button for Towers.

**Thoughts:**:  Need to learn more about keeping an index with each mapped item (or just looking at content). Small progress is still progress!

**Where/When I Worked**: Worked just a little bit this morning at work. Spent time coding during the bachelor too - so not super concentrated work. 

**Tomorrow's Goals:**: New Component? Study time? We will see!

### Day 8: January 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Today was a busier day, so mostly worked through some javascript-exercises work! Learned more about some javascript array/string methods and also what an octal literal is. 

**Thoughts:**:  Did not have as much time today as I would have hoped, but I have a lot more time tomorrow. I need to get better with pop, push, shift, and unshift. 

**Where/When I Worked**: At work, in little spouts. 

**Tomorrow's Goals:**: Many many things!

### Day 9: January 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Hodge Podge day! During work I spent a little bit of time on the reverse number JS function. Had a couple hurdles to get over like how to keep the negative sign at the beginning, and how to get rid of the trailing 0's. This evening I added some more projects to my portfolio page, and did a minior styling change to towers of Hanoi. 

**Thoughts:**:  Learned more about scope, and a simpler way to check for leading/trailing 0's by using a while loop and .pop(). 

**Where/When I Worked**: A little bit at work (should have been able to do more) and a little bit at home!

**Tomorrow's Goals:**: Change up my coding time! Going to code before work and gym in the evening. I've felt very distracted once I get home, maybe this will help. Hope to get back into the backend this weekend.

### Day 11: January 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Went through a tutorial on making a to-do app! 

**Thoughts:**:  Well I forgot to post about this day and got lost, so dunno. 

**Where/When I Worked**: Starbucks Coffee from 6:15 - 7:15am. 

**Tomorrow's Goals:**: 

**Link to work**: 


### Day 11: January 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Learned a little bit more about my to-do app code. Added in a delete button that is attached to the ID instead of the input it was originally in.

**Thoughts:**:  Need to learn more about the code I'm actually writing & be able to discuss it. 

**Where/When I Worked**: Summer Moon Coffee from 6:15 - 7:15am. 

**Tomorrow's Goals:**: Whatever my heart desires!

### Day 12: January 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Not a lot of work got done today... I enjoyed my first ATX Sprint Squad workout, lunch at Malibu Poke, and HH w/ Roya at Lazarus. Sometimes it's important to have 'me' days! I spent some time looking at old classwork from ACA today. 

**Thoughts:**:  Need to have a dedicated goal for tomorrow, and time not at Mardigan's place. 

**Where/When I Worked**: Mardigan's table while they watched TV.

**Tomorrow's Goals:**: Have something tangible to show!

**Link to work**: [none]


### Day 13: January 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Realized I was a day behind on my coding log, guess the weekend was good for my brain! I was pretty preoccupied with fun stuff, workouts, meal prepping, etc to spend the time on my own projects. I instead did some JS30 work on the sliding nav bar.

**Thoughts:**:  This was fun! Would be really cool to implement into a full stack project soon. 

**Where/When I Worked**: At home, from about 9pm to 10:30pm.

**Tomorrow's Goals:**: Code. Code. Code. Maybe a JS function warm up, then getting back to the backend work.

### Day 14: January 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Great Monday! I was able to smash through at least two JS funciton exercises! I also spent some time going through my Towers of Hanoi project and found the key/index error and it wasn't even where I thought it was messing up. I also figured out a way to use that key to style each individual p tag differently. 

**Thoughts:**: Great job today (to myself!), you rocked it! I also got a chance to encourage another developer who is currently in school. I love that I can connect with so many people and inspire others to keep the code going. 

**Where/When I Worked**: A tiny bit in Dr. Sundqvists office, mostly at home during and post Bachelor (about 7:00pm to 9:30pm).

**Tomorrow's Goals:**: Add Widget Workshop to my portfolio page for sure! If I have time I would like to make the styling on Towers prettier. But tomorrow is also my first job placement course, so we will see!

### Day 15: January 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Messed around a little bit on my towers of hanoi project trying to flip around the stacks, not tons of progress made thus far. I got rid of the numbers in the stacks. Also messed around with the gradient background on my Stripe Follow background, but didn't get it just right yet. Tonight is my first ACA job placement class, so not a lot of time to do anything else today. 

**Thoughts:**:  Attempts still count as progress! I have a better idea of where to go for tomorrow. 

**Where/When I Worked**: At work during lunch mostly. 

**Tomorrow's Goals:**: JOB SEARCH DAY! And LinkedIn, and Portfolio.

### Day 16: January 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: So. Much. Accomplished! I woke up this morning and had a phone call with a recruiter at 7am. I then finished an hour long technical test for that role. I worked on many projects development wise. I decided I didn't like how my Widget Workshop looked so I changed it up to have a central transparent background title + a full page background image. I think it will look much cleaner in the end. I also added my weather app to it! Then I worked a good bit on changing up my README's so that it is easier for other people to see what my projects are about. I updated my portfolio, weather app, and widget workshop. I did some job applications as well. My evening was spent whiteboarding an app I am going to build! 

**Thoughts:**:  I need days like this more often. It was no chore to sit at my computer all day. I did take a gym break and a bath/relaxation break, but most of my day was spent working away! I am very nervous to start my own app (and API) but I need to push myself. 

**Where/When I Worked**: At home! Did't finish up my day until 7:30pm.

**Tomorrow's Goals:**: Start API? Get Native up & running?

### Day 17: January 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started the Udemy React Native course again! Had some struggles installing the Expo CLI, but I think I got it all working now!

**Thoughts:**:  Wish I would have had more time today to get it started. 

**Where/When I Worked**: At work

**Tomorrow's Goals:**: Get something tangible up w/ Native

**Link to work**: [udemy]


### Day 18: January 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Not as much actual coding as I would have liked. I continued on with the React Native course and got most of my environments set up. Taking a long time for Android Studio to download so I messed with some nav styling in my Widget Workshop app. 

**Thoughts:**: React Native will be fun once I get it all set up! I also am having some errors on my react-bootstrap in the WW so I will need to work on those later. 

**Where/When I Worked**: Alise's apartment - babysitting night!

**Tomorrow's Goals:**: Finish Android Studio set up.

**Link to work**: [WidgetWorkshop]


### Day 19: January 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Not much on the native side of things. Got to practice a couple JS functions.

**Thoughts:**: Android Studio is the worst and so is the wifi here. 

**Where/When I Worked**: Mardigan's place

**Tomorrow's Goals:**: Native.

### Day 20: January 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Watched a lot of videos on interview prep & react! I also dove back into some Widget Workshop stuff to figure out the warnings I had with the Dropdown menu. I was able to fix the 'id' error as well as the nested anchor tags. I had to install react-router-bootstrap instead of using the react-router-dom. 

**Thoughts:**: Hoping that all the videos I watched refreshed my brain enough for the interviews coming up!

**Where/When I Worked**: At home. Watched videos while meal prepping and coded at my desk after.

**Tomorrow's Goals:**: Study for interview!

**Link to work**: [WidgetWorkshop]


### Day 21: January 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Still makin' it! Worked on my weather app by adding a celcius/fahrenheit button that actually changes the API call. Still figuring out how to get the radio buttons to only change the 'f' and 'c' on submit. Also used some ComponentWillUnmount for a couple fixes, still need to figure it out on my clock app. 

**Thoughts:**: Learnin'. Want to practice more API/fetch stuff.

**Where/When I Worked**: At home during the bachelor. 

**Tomorrow's Goals:**: Interview! Gonna have to do some late night studying/coding.

**Link to work**: [WidgetWorkshop]


### Day 22: January 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Group coding interview practice @ ACA and small work/research on Widgets.

**Thoughts:**: Today was a crazy busy day. The algorithims we did in class were very easy though (:

**Where/When I Worked**: At ACA + a little at work.

**Tomorrow's Goals:**: Get more tangible coding in.

**Link to work**: [none]


### Day 23: January 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started off the day without a real plan, so I kind of jumped around a little bit. I had my computer at work but forgot the charger so that put a hinderence in things. Tonight I was able to get started on a timer component for my app. I started off by following a tutorial but then realized I need to do it on my own!

**Thoughts:**: I need to be better about setting daily goals. 

**Where/When I Worked**: At work a little bit (Kyle), but mostly at home between 7-9.

**Tomorrow's Goals:**: Set a plan of action and follow it. I need to review my technical assessment and work more on my timer. (Maybeeee Native?)

**Link to work**: [WidgetWorkshop]


### Day 24: January 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Great progress today! Got a working countdown timer. Figuring out getting the future date was the biggest challenge. I also had an interview today so I spent a lot of my morning finishing my technical assessment (turned out to be great, they asked about it!). Today is also an ACA class day. 

**Thoughts:**: Feeling much better today about my progress. Excited to continue working on my app.

**Where/When I Worked**: At work, we had a slow day. 

**Tomorrow's Goals:**: Continue to work on my countdown app! 

**Link to work**: [WidgetWorkshop]



### Day 25: January 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Break day! I had an early morning workout, very busy day at work, and Mardigan's party. Really enjoyed my day and still made the most of it even though I didn't code. 

**Thoughts:**: Get back on the grind!

**Where/When I Worked**: n/a

**Tomorrow's Goals:**: More work on countdown timer (inputs).

**Link to work**: n/a


### Day 26: January 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Lots of work on my countdown timer today! I was able to get the inputs working and linked to the local state. 

**Thoughts:**: I like working with dates and times! Using JS methods that are built in can be fun if they are useful.

**Where/When I Worked**: At the leasing office in Mardigan's apartment. 

**Tomorrow's Goals:**: Continue work on countdown timer (edge cases, bugs, etc)

**Link to work**: [WidgetWorkshop]


### Day 27: January 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I got my countdown timer working great! It now gives an error if it's a previous year, or invalid month/date. I still have some other edge cases to work but I am overall happy with my work. The styling also looks great.

**Thoughts:**: Great job today!

**Where/When I Worked**: Mardigan's couch + table mostly. 

**Tomorrow's Goals:**: Interview prep.

**Link to work**: [WidgetWorkshop]


### Day 28: January 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Lots of little things. I started off my day (while waiting for pop a lock to jumpstart my car) by adding some pseudo classes to my Countdown timer for styling reasons. In the morning I started a Udemy class on Salesforce/Apex and mostly learned about the primitive data types. At night (although distracted) I did a JavaScript30 'Whack-A-Mole' tutorial. 

**Thoughts:**: Wish I had more time tomorrow for interview prep. Overall did good with the time I had today.

**Where/When I Worked**: Kitchen, work, and at home. 

**Tomorrow's Goals:**: Get through the networking event!

**Link to work**: [Udemy, JS30, and WidgetWorkshop]


### Day 29: January 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Study practice mostly. I have 3 interviews tomorrow. 

**Thoughts:**: Good luck on the interviews!

**Where/When I Worked**: At work a little bit, some at home before bed. Today was the day my car got broken into so I didn't have much time/will. Class was at a networking event. 

**Tomorrow's Goals:**: Rock the interviews!

**Link to work**: [none]



### Day 30: January 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: INTERVEIW DAY! Not any coding, but lots of studying for SQL, for loops, and Salesforce. 

**Thoughts:**: Hope interview's go well! They are all not in my current tech stacks.

**Where/When I Worked**: At home mostly, some at Capital Factory.

**Tomorrow's Goals:**: Relax a bit, today was a doosey.

**Link to work**: [none]



### Day 31: January 31, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Mostly worked on coding challenges! We did a lot of whiteboarding in class today. One was on the birthday candle (tallest candle) challenge, and the other was on a sort without using built in JS methods.

**Thoughts:**: I need to practice my bubble sorting. 

**Where/When I Worked**: In class mostly.

**Tomorrow's Goals:**: Find a project!

### Day 33: February 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Lots of front-end work! I got a good head start on my Mochi Austin project. I got the header finished and added in a carousel from bootstrap.

**Thoughts:**: Fun time working on the HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. 

**Where/When I Worked**: Mardigan's apartment while he was playing volleyball. 

**Tomorrow's Goals:**: More work on Mochi!
