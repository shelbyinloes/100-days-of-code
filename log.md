# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on getting general layout started for my Widget Workshop app. Fixed the React Router to work with my navigation buttons. Created a logo for the site. Deployed site using Netlify. But most importantly - started somthing to help me to stay on track! 

**Thoughts:**: Excited to finally get a practice plan in progress. Once I get the WW site up and running, I want to implement some older projects into it to add content. I think I have a good handle on React Router, just need to fix the nav bar as well as the bootstrap grid issues. Hope to see even more progress tomorrow.

**Where/When I Worked**: Mostly at home mid day, had the day off for NYD. Finished up a couple things at Yard Bar around 5.

**Tomorrow's Goals:**: Fix bootstrap issues, finish general WW layout.

### Day 2: January 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Realized all of my bootstrap issues were because I forgot to add the CDN into my index.html file... So once that was up I started working through fixing the layout how I wanted. Towards the end of the night I started brainstorming how I would tackle translating Vanilla JS files (with Canvas, mind you) into a JSX/React Component. 

**Thoughts:**: I am in for a lot, but will also learn a lot. I want to be able to push myself. Even if that means I get stuck and don't make a ton of progress in one day - just means I have less things to attempt the next day. 

**Where/When I Worked**: Had a slow afternoon at the WESTL clinic, so got some work done there (maybe 2 good hours). Finished up some work at home from 7-8:30ish. Typing this at 9:30 then headed to bed!

**Tomorrow's Goals:**: Refresh memory on event handling, state, and prop types. Start tackling a canvas project if I can!
